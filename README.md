# Parking Area Manager

Parking Area Manager is a Java program that allows you to manage a parking area with a capacity of 100m. The program can allocate suitable spaces for vehicles according to their length and the available spaces, and mark spaces as free when vehicles leave the parking area. If two contiguous spaces are free, the program will merge them.

There are four types of vehicles supported by the program: trucks (length 7m), buses (length 10m), cars (length 5m), and motorcycles (length 2m). The program also includes a GUI with a dark mode theme.

## Features

- Add a vehicle to the parking area
